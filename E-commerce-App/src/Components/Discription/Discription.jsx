          <p>An e-commerce website is a type of website where people can buy and sell products or services online. It acts like a digital shop, allowing customers to browse items, add them to a cart, pay using online methods, and get the products delivered â€” all through the internet.
          </p>
          <p>The website contains a catalog or product listing where users can view various products or services. Each item has a title, description, price, images, availability, and sometimes customer ratings and reviews. Products are often organized into categories (e.g., Electronics, Clothing, Furniture) to make navigation easy.
